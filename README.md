My mother really enjoys baking. Her grandmother emigrated to the US from Italy, so she grew up cooking and baking with her. For a few years, my mother was obsessed with baking biscotti, an italian cookie. Sometimes they'd taste pretty good, other times they would taste like :poop:. One day, when we were visiting her mother/my grandmother, she decided to test her hand and bake some there. Well, they were so hard that when my brother - who had to be around 10 years old - took a bite out of one, one of his baby teeth fell out. It was so friggin hilarious that we couldn't help but laugh :laughing:
